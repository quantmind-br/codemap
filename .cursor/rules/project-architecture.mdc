# Project Architecture: The Code Analysis Pipeline

The `codemap` project follows a strict, unidirectional pipeline architecture: Code Scanning -> Knowledge Graph -> Analysis/Rendering. All development must respect these package boundaries and the flow of data.

## 1. Core Pipeline Stages and Package Responsibilities

The system operates as a layered pipeline, ensuring separation of concerns:

| Package | Role | Key Data Produced/Consumed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `@scanner` | Data Ingestion & AST Parsing (Tree-sitter). | Produces `scanner.FileAnalysis`, `scanner.FuncInfo`. |
| `@graph` | Central Data Repository (Knowledge Graph). | Stores and queries `graph.Node`/`graph.Edge`. |
| `@analyze` | LLM Interaction & RAG Engine. | Consumes `graph` data, implements `analyze.Client`. |
| `@render` | Presentation Layer (TUI/CLI Output). | Consumes `graph` and `scanner` data for visualization. |

## 2. Central Data Model: graph.CodeGraph

The `graph.CodeGraph` is the single source of truth for the codebase structure, managed by `@graph/store.go`.

- **Persistence:** The graph is serialized using `encoding/gob` and stored in the binary file `.codemap/graph.gob`. This file must not be manually modified.
- **Integrity Rule:** When loading the graph from disk (e.g., in `runQueryMode`), the `CodeGraph.RebuildIndexes()` method must be called immediately after deserialization to ensure in-memory maps are consistent.
- **Node IDs:** All graph nodes must use stable, deterministic IDs generated by the `graph.GenerateNodeID(path, symbol)` utility to support incremental indexing and vector mapping.

## 3. Execution Flow and Configuration

- **Entry Point:** The `main.go` file acts as the central command router, dispatching control flow based on CLI flags (e.g., `--index`, `--explain`, `--deps`). All mode-specific logic resides in the `run*Mode` functions.
- **Configuration:** The `@config` package manages all settings (API keys, model names). Configuration is loaded once at startup and passed down to components (e.g., `analyze.NewClient(cfg)`).
- **File Filtering:** The `@scanner` must use the `go-gitignore` library to respect `.gitignore` rules loaded by `scanner/git.go` before processing any file.
